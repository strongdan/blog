title: Choosing a Programming Language
---

As a person who is still actively trying to learn to program, I might not have the most insight about choosing a programming language. 
However, since I've spent years struggling, I have a few thoughts on picking a beginning language. First of all, you have to decide what
you would eventually like to do as a programmer. That's a tough decision when you're just starting out, but try to narrow it down somewhat
based on your interests. Do you like research and discovery and math? Try learning R or Python (choose only one initially) so you can work
as a data analyst or data scientist. Do you enjoy layout and beautiful graphics? Learn Javascript (along with HTML and CSS) in order to land
a job as a front-end developer. Honestly, front-end seems to encompass quite a bit more than just design. 

1. Should be open source 
2. Large/supportive developer community
3. Broad utility
4. Quick and easy to learn

## Ruby

## Python

## Javascript


I began with Python a few years ago and I really appreciate its readability and ease of learning. I learned via Charles "Chuck" Severance 
Programming for Everybody course, and I loved it... mostly because of the instructor. 

A great deal has been written on this subject, but I suggest that you not worry too much about which language you start with. Most high-level languages have many of the same features, and once you learn a single language well other languages will be pretty simple to learn. Spend a little bit of time deciding on what field you'd like to enter into - front-end or back-end web development, game development, data analysis, mobile development (iOS or Android), or something else entirely. The most important thing is to get started working with ANY programming language. Trust that you will progress from there.
