With [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) beginning tomorrow, this seems like a good time to go over how to get started contributing to open source projects. You probably have a sense that contributing is good for your career, but why should you do it? And how do you get started? [Github](https://github.com/github) has an excellent [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) on participating in open source projects.

<h3>Open Source Friday</h3>

[Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/) is an initiative created by GitHub folks (and friends) meant to get more people involved in open source projects. The [goal](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/open-source-friday-give-back) is to promote regular, sustainable effort on the part of developers and engage employers in the process. It's a "weekly reminder to give some time back to the projects that power your daily work."
