title: Basic Data Science Process

There are a variety of ways to approach data processing and interpretation, including ingest, model, query, analyze, and visualize (IMQAV). I’m just getting started with the field of data science, and I prefer a simpler format suggested by Udacity:

1.	Wrangling
2.	Exploration
3.	Drawing Conclusions
4.	Communicating Findings

The wrangling phase includes reading in data, cleaning it, merging files and handling missing data. In other words, this step is simply making the data usable for analysis. 

The exploratory phase involves visualizing the data and looking at the relationships between different variables. This is where a data scientist begins to pick up on trends and patterns.

The conclusions phase is where an analyst’s findings are drawn together into a coherent narrative, which is communicated via visualizations and summary text during the communications phase. A good analysis also incorporates statistical tests performed and limitations inherent in the data and the findings. 

I’ll outline this process using the Lahman baseball statistics below:
