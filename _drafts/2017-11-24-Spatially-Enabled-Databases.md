title: Spatially-enabled Databases
---

A spatially-enabled database, on the other hand, is aware of the notion of space, and allows you to work with spatial objects and concepts directly. In particular, a spatially-enabled database allows you to:

    Store spatial data types (points, lines, polygons, and so on) directly in the database in the form of a geometry column

    Perform spatial queries on your data, for example, select all landmarks within 10 km of the city named "San Francisco"

    Perform spatial joins on your data, for example, select all cities and their associated countries by joining cities and countries on (city inside country)

    Create new spatial objects using various spatial functions, for example, set "danger_zone" to the intersection of the "flooded_area" and "urban_area" polygons
