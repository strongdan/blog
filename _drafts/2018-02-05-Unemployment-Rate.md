title: How is the Unemployment Rate Calculated?
---

### Basic Labor Market Information Concepts

* Labor force - 
* Employed - 
* Unemployed - 
* Unemployment Rate - 

### Local Area Unemployment Statistics
LAUS state estimates are produced using time series models to estimate the true values of household employment and unemployment from state Current Population Survey (CPS) series, which contain sampling error. The estimates consist of trend and seasonal components that sum to the not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data series.

During estimation, constraints are imposed requiring the sum-of-state NSA model estimates exactly equal the national CPS estimates of employment and unemployment. This process, called real-time benchmarking, makes the models more robust to sudden shocks to the overall economy.
