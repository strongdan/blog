title: How is the Unemployment Rate Calculated?
---

Have you ever been curious about how the unemployment rate is calculated? Perhaps you thought it was a pretty straightforward process, simply dividing the number of unemployed by the total workforce. At a fundamental level that is what happens, but it's not quite that simple. 

First of all, coming up with unemployment numbers is not easy. Unemployment insurance claims are a small percentage of a much larger estimate of unemployed individuals. The US Census Current Population Survey - which provides a count of people working and not working (among other things) - provides an estimate of unemployed individuals that feeds into the unemployment model. The Railroad Retirement Board (the analog to the UI system for railroad workers) also provides some data on unemployment. 

All told, there least eight different sources of data that feed into the monthly unemployment rate. In this post, I'll do my best to provide a quick introduction to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics program and how it produces publishable data.

### Basic Labor Market Concepts
The labor market is a name given to the concept of the supply and demand for labor. In this marketplace, employers provide the demand for workers and workers provide the supply. There are some basic econonomic concepts that you'll want to have a handle on before we delve into how the unemployment rate is calculated in the United States, including:

* Labor force - the combined number of individuals who can work, including both employed and unemployed
* Employed - The definition for employed people is different between BLS programs, but essentially includes anyone from the labor force (16 or older) who worked during a specific time period
* Unemployed - The unemployed are those individuals in the labor force who were not working during a specific time period, but who were available for work (ie. not sick or waiting to be recalled). These individuals also must have made an effort to find employment during the specified time. 
* Unemployment Rate - the unemployment rate is the ratio of the unemployed as a component of the labor force

### Local Area Unemployment Statistics
LAUS state estimates are produced using time series models to estimate the true values of household employment and unemployment from state Current Population Survey (CPS) series, which contain sampling error. The estimates consist of trend and seasonal components that sum to the not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data series.

During estimation, constraints are imposed requiring the sum-of-state NSA model estimates exactly equal the national CPS estimates of employment and unemployment. This process, called real-time benchmarking, makes the models more robust to sudden shocks to the overall economy.

### Data Sources for LAUS
  #### Surveys
    1. Current Population Survey (CPS)
    2. Current Employment Statistics (CES)
    3. American Community Survey (ACS)

  #### Censuses
    1. Decennial Census
    2. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)

  #### Administrative Data
    1. Unemployment Insurance (UI)
    2. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)
    3. Intercensal Estimates
