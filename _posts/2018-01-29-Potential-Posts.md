title: Possible Blog Post Topics
---

I maintain a list of potential posts, which usually don't get written unless I have a lot of downtime. Often posts are researched or written when I'm sitting in an airport or a hotel room. "Regular" life doesn't seem to provide enough time to focus on these things for long. This post is an opportunity for me to revisit some ideas I've been meaning to write about but haven't found the time to do so. This is the first real assignment for the #cnc2018 blog more challenge. For this assignment, our instructions are as follows: 
`Come up with 10 blog ideas, then narrow those down to 3. For this challenge, your blog should fall into 1 of 3 categories: tutorial, project, explainer.` 

Just as a reminder from my prior post on this topic, tutorials are "step-by-step guides with instructions to teach the reader how to do something specific," while projects are "a breakdown that explains a technical concept to the reader," and explainers are "posts that talks about a project you worked on and explains the journey and technical challenge you experienced." I started out with four tutorial ideas, four project ideas and two explainer ideas:

### Tutorial
1. _Tidy Data_ - explain Hadley Wickham's ideas about what is meant by tidy data
2. _Basic Statistics_ in Pandas and SciPy - a brief refresher on available statistical tests in Python 
3. _Pivot Tables_ - explanation of the use of pivot tables in Python and Excel
4. _Geographic Data_ - a post to get newbies up to speed using Python's geographic libraries

### Project
1. _Web Scraping_ - an introduction to web scraping in Python
2. _Sortino Ratio_ - a project to become familiar with Sortino Ratio
3. _D3 Intro_ - a quick intro to getting started with D3.js for data visualization
4. _Funnel Analysis_ - creating a funnel analysis in Python or SQL

### Explainer
1. _Data Analysis Project Using data.world_ - an introduction to accessing data.world from Jupyter notebooks
2. _Populating Your Portfolio_ - how to create projects that will result in an impressive online portfolio
