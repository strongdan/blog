<h3>How to Get Started Contributing to Open Source</h3> 

![Hacktoberfest]({{https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/}}../assets/hacktoberfest.jpg)

With [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) beginning tomorrow, this seems like a good time to go over how to get started contributing to open source projects. You probably have a sense that contributing is good for your career, but why should you do it? And how do you get started? [Github](https://github.com/github) has an excellent [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) on participating in open source projects, but there are tons of other great resources (see the links at the bottom of this post). 

<h3>What is Open Source?</h3>

![Open Source Initiative]({{https://opensource.org/}}../assets/Opensource.png)

[Open source software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) has a license allowing anyone ot inspect, modify or enhance. Open source projects "embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development." 

s authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it. LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program are examples of open source software.

<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>

Many people contribute to open source because they believe in the open source ethos and enjoy being part of the community. Beginners might not see the value of giving their valuable time to these projects. As a contributor, you are helping build software that anyone can use or repurpose, including yourself. And although I hate this expression, you're "paying it forward" so that others will want to help you if you should choose to create your own open source software. 

If altruistic reasons are insufficient, there are tons of practical reasons to be a part of the open source community. As a contributor to (or a lurker on) open source projects, you have access to codebases you would ordinarily only see as a professional developer. You can see how software projects are constructed and you'll be exposed to best practices in programming. There's really no better way to learn to program than to read lots of well-written and commented code, then write your own part of that code. By contributing, you'll also have an opportunity to develop your coding resume. Making software that's open source allows newbies to develop their skills on smaller, but still important, issues while more experienced developers can devote their time to the more difficult problems.

<h3>Open Source Friday</h3>

![Open Source Friday]({{https://opensourcefriday.com/}}../assets/openSourceFriday.jpg)

[Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/) is an initiative created by GitHub folks (and friends) meant to get more people involved in open source projects. The [goal](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/open-source-friday-give-back) is to promote regular, sustainable effort on the part of developers and engage employers in the process. It's a "weekly reminder to give some time back to the projects that power your daily work."
