title: Big Data vs. Small Data
---

What is big data anyway? 

Big data can be defined as data sets that take up a large volume, data streams that have a large velocity, and/or a large variety of data formats. [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/what-is-big-data.html#) also defines two additional dimensions of big data: variability (inconsistent or perodic data flows) and complexity (data in different formats and types that is difficult to link, match and cleanse).

[Small data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_data), on the other hand, is comprehensible and accessible to people, not just computers. Wikipedia explains that big data is about machines, while small data is about people. In fact, big data is often too big to understand without breaking it into small chunks that can be analyzed and visualized by a person.
