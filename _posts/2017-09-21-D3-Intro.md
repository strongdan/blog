<h3>Creating Your First D3 Graph</h3>

![D3 Image](D3screenshot.png)

D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a data visualization JavaScript library that works in the browser. D3 documents utilize Scalable Vector Graphics that rely on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you've taken the time to look at the [D3 website](https://d3js.org/), you'll know there's a lot there. Getting started using D3 can be a bit frustrating, but the power that D3 provides makes the effort of learning the library worthwhile. In this post, I'll go through a simple example that illustrates D3 functionality where we bind some data to DOM elements and utilize D3's data-driven transformations to generate a simple graph. To get started, you'll need at a bare minimum a Javascript file and an HTML file, but you may also want a CSS file for styling. I would suggest linking directly to the source rather than downloading a copy of [D3]() to your project folder. You can reference D3 from the head of your document like this: `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>`. 

```
let data = []

d3.select('.chart')
	.selectAll('div') # creates an empty selection within parent div
	.data(data) # invoke data method with previously defined data variable
		.enter() # creates placeholder elements for each value in data
		.append('div') # appends a div to each placeholder
		.style('width', function(d) { return d + "px"; }) # d represents current element, add pixel to the end
		.text(function(d) { return d; }); # return 
```		



HTML
<div class="chart"></div>
