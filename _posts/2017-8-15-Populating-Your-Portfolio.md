title: What Should You Put in Your Portfolio?
---

<h3>What should prospective data scientists put in their portfolio?</h3>

What you put in your portfolio page depends a great deal on where your interests lie, but tech firm hiring managers tend to like to see some similar things. You should demonstrate that you can do most basic programming tasks for your language of choice but beyond that, documentation, readability, functionality and performance, and variation are important to see in your portfolio or Github profile. 

What does this mean for prospective data scientists?

<h3>Documentation</h3>

First and foremost, ensure that you provide a basic readme markdown file to indicate what the code is intended to do, and do your best to provide sufficient detail for people unfamiliar with this kind of project.

<h3>Readability</h3>

Next, take the time to make your code readable and understandable. Opt for readability over conciseness if you have to choose one. If your code is difficult to understand, programmers who work with you and those who work with your code after you're done will be frustrated. 

Showcasing your code in the form of Jupyter notebooks will make them much more accessible. Jupyter notebooks include functionality for markdown cells and they render well on Github. 

<h3>Functionality and Performance</h3>

It's also important that your code runs without crashing, and does what it's intended to do. If you have time, ensure that your code is performant, but this is less important and can be accomplished during refactoring. 

<h3>Variation</h3>

Make sure that you include some variation, both in the types of languages you use and in the kinds of projects you showcase. Being a specialist is okay, but being adaptable and willing to learn is probably more important in tech. 

<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>

Open source contributions show that you're passionate about something and engaged in a community. That can translate into the  tech work environment, where teamwork is often crucial. Take the time to participate in open source projects.
