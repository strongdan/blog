Teaching yourself to program is difficult for a number of reasons, but I've found for myself the biggest problem is distraction. I've always been distractible and I've found focusing on one thing for an extended period difficult. But learning online exposes a person to an insane number of great resources, almost on a daily basis, and it’s tough to filter through all of the various tutorials and stick to one thing. One filter that I’ve often applied is a financial one: I don’t like to pay to learn to code when there are so many incredible free resources. Yet I’ve broken this rule as well, in part because I see the value in learning with others and because a financial commitment is pretty good motivation. Plus, paid resources can be a lot better than the free ones. I started out with Codecademy many years ago, and hopped around quite a lot. I spent a bit of time with Free Code Camp, but never achieved a certificate. I still plan to go back. I paid money for Hack Reactor’s boot camp prep program called the Structured Study Program, and that was incredible! I managed to get admitted to Hack Reactor, but there’s no way I can afford the $18,000 tuition. Instead, I’m going to continue with mostly free resources, but I am paying for two very good and inexpensive programs that I hope will get me on my feet as a programmer. One is [Udacity’s Intro to Programming nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000), which I’m honestly not sure is worth much in the developer community. The other is Codecademy’s beta Front-End Web App program, which will teach me enough Javascript and React to build two of my own apps. I figure, if nothing else, both of these programs are inexpensive and both will contribute to my portfolio, which is pretty sad-looking right now. I’m excited to start!
