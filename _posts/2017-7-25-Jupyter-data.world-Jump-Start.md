[Jupyter Logo]()

Jupyter (JUlia, PYThon and R) Notebooks is an incredible resource for data analysis and visualization, whether you use R or Python... or some other crazy language. The notebooks are a great way to share code and create tutorials because they meld markup and other rich text elements with Python code that can be run within the notebook. A number of data visualization libraries work quite well in JupyterI’m just discovering the power of Jupyter Notebooks, and I’ll provide a quick overview of how to get started using a data.world data set. 

* You can install Jupyter from the command line by typing ```pip3 install jupyter```. Jupyter also comes as part of an Anaconda install. If you just want to try it out go to [try.jupyter.org](https://try.jupyter.org/). 

* Jupyter notebooks are run from a local server which you launch using the terminal: ```Jupyter Notebook```. An optional third parameter is used to indicate the directory to open the server from. 

(Server)[]

* When you first run your server, your default browser will open up at <b>localhost:8888</b> showing the file structure of your default directory. You can create new Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks by clicking the <b>New</b> dropdown on the top right. I typically choose to create a Python [default] notebook.

* Notebooks are made up of cells, which can contain Python (or a variety of other languages) code, math equations, graphs or markdown.
