Jupyter (JUlia, PYThon and R) Notebooks is an incredible resource for data analysis and visualization, whether you use R or Python... or some other crazy language. The notebooks are a great way to share code and create tutorials because they meld markup and other rich text elements with Python code that can be run within the notebook. A number of data visualization libraries work quite well in JupyterI’m just discovering the power of Jupyter Notebooks, and I’ll provide a quick overview of how to get started using a data.world data set. 

1. You can install Jupyter from the command line with _pip3_ _install_ _jupyter_. Jupyter also comes as part of an Anaconda install. 

2. Jupyter notebooks are run from a local server which you launch using the command line: _Jupyter_ _Notebook_. An optional third parameter is used to indicate the directory to open the server from.
