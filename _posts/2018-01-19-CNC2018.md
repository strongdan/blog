# Code Newbie Challenge

I just joined the [Code Newbie Challenge](http://bit.ly/2DISkLU) for 2018, and for my challenge I chose to blog more. We've gotten our first assignment, and it goes as follows:

PRE-MISSION: Read 3 tech blog posts you wish you wrote. Jot down why you like them and what you'd change.

GOAL: Find examples of good tech writing to see what you'd like to incorporate into your own posts, and what you might want to avoid. You'll refer back to these later in your challenge.
