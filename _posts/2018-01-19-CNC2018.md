# Code Newbie Challenge

I just joined [Saron Yitbarek's](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@saronyitbarek) 2018 [Code Newbie Challenge](http://bit.ly/2DISkLU). #cnc2018

For my challenge I chose to blog more. We've gotten our first assignment, and it goes as follows:

PRE-MISSION: Read 3 tech blog posts you wish you wrote. Jot down why you like them and what you'd change.

GOAL: Find examples of good tech writing to see what you'd like to incorporate into your own posts, and what you might want to avoid. You'll refer back to these later in your challenge.

Saron says that most tech posts fall into three categories: tutorial, explainer or project. The goal is to read through a blog post in each subject and reflect on three things I liked and three I didn't. Below are three Medium articles I felt were interesting.

## Tutorial
[Cleansing Your Data with Pandas](https://medium.com/we-are-orb/cleansing-your-data-with-pandas-9fb639487a10)

## Explainer
[Bits, Bytes, Building With Binary](https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa)

## Project
