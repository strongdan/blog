# Code Newbie Challenge 2018

I just joined [Saron Yitbarek's](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@saronyitbarek) 2018 [Code Newbie Challenge](http://bit.ly/2DISkLU), and for my challenge I chose to blog more. #cnc2018

If you would like to join, sign up [here](https://2018.codenewbie.org/). You'll get an email with these instructions:

```
PRE-MISSION: Read 3 tech blog posts you wish you wrote. Jot down why you like them and what you'd change.

GOAL: Find examples of good tech writing to see what you'd like to incorporate into your own posts, and what you might want to avoid. You'll refer back to these later in your challenge.
```

Saron says that most tech posts fall into three categories: tutorial, explainer or project. The goal for challenge participants is to read through a blog post in each subject and reflect on three things I liked and three I didn't. Here are three Medium articles I felt were interesting.

## Tutorial
### [Hugo + Firebase: How to create your own static website for free in minutes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hugo-firebase-how-to-create-your-own-dynamic-website-for-free-in-minutes-463b4fb7bf5a)

This post is a super short [Free Code Camp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) tutorial that walks you through the process for creating a static blog. This is a nice process because it involves no programming and is free. [Aravind](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@aravindputrevu) suggests using this process for a portfolio or blog, and he outlines the steps for creating a blog. 

#### What I Liked
I liked how clearly it was written, with each step clearly delineated. I also appreciated that shell commands were written out and separated from the rest of the text. The post was nice and concise, without a ton of extraneous fluff or documentation. Each service or framework (eg. Hugo, Firebase, Node.js) needed for this project was quickly described. 

#### What I Would do Differently
There were a handful of issues I had with the post. Although I like not being pointed to the documentation at the beginning of posts, a list of handy links are always nice at the end. I also would have liked to see and example of the site that was created for this tutorial and maybe even some code on GitHub. Finally, it would be useful for some users to provide a some common troubleshooting problems and their solution. None of these issues were dealbreakers and omitting them made for a short read, which I really appreciate. 

## Explainer
### [Bits, Bytes, Building With Binary](https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa)
![]()
In this BaseCS post, [Vaidehi](https://medium.com/@vaidehijoshi) makes a great point: "Binary is something that few programmers think about these days. Deep down, we know that itâ€™s important and worth learning about, yet can seem so overwhelming and kind of unnecessary to think about." That's been my experience with binary. I've read about it before and felt like I understood it, but it's not something that I ever make use of and has mostly been forgotten.
