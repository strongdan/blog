title: How to Use BLS API
---

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has a vast repository of labor market information for the United States and its territories, most of it down to the county or city level. However, gaining access to the specific data you want requires clicking through various sites and using their database query tools. If you have some basic programming ability, there's a more direct route.  BLS has public and private APIs (application programming interfaces) that allow programmers to retrieve any published data in JSON format. In order to get started, you'll want to register a [public API data account](https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/). Registering allows you to access version 2.0 of the API, which provides access to additional data more frequently (up to 500 queries a day). There is additional functionality such as the ability to add calculations and annual averages to requests, along with series descriptions. 

Just as a quick introduction to BLS data, there are [data](https://www.bls.gov/data/) for inflation & prices (cost of living, etc.), employment (and employment projections), unemployment, pay and benefits, spending and time use, productivity, workplace injuries, occupational requirements, regional resources, international import/export price indexes, along with a large amount of historical data. Finding the specific table - referred to by their series ID - which can be tricky. Series IDs follow a consistent format 

The BLS Public Data API requires users to know the series ID to request data. We do not currently have a catalogue of series IDs, but all BLS series IDs follow a similar [format](https://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm). For example, the series ID for national employment, hours and earnings is CEU0800000003. 

Fortunately for newbies like me, BLS provides [sample code](https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_sample_code.htm) for making API requests in C#, Java, PHP, Python, R, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, SAS, Unix Command Line, Matlab and Julia. Since I'm interested in Python, I've selected the Python sample code as a template for my API request. 

```
import requests
import json
import prettytable
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
data = json.dumps({"seriesid": ['CUUR0000SA0','SUUR0000SA0'],"startyear":"2011", "endyear":"2014"})
p = requests.post('https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/', data=data, headers=headers)
json_data = json.loads(p.text)
for series in json_data['Results']['series']:
    x=prettytable.PrettyTable(["series id","year","period","value","footnotes"])
    seriesId = series['seriesID']
    for item in series['data']:
        year = item['year']
        period = item['period']
        value = item['value']
        footnotes=""
        for footnote in item['footnotes']:
            if footnote:
                footnotes = footnotes + footnote['text'] + ','
       'if 'M01' <= period <= 'M12':'
            x.add_row([seriesId,year,period,value,footnotes[0:-1]])
    output = open(seriesId + '.txt','w')
    output.write (x.get_string())
    output.close()
```
