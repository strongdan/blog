title: Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree
---

I finally managed to finish the Intro to Programming nanodegree after about three months of off-and-on work. It wasn't a hugely satisfying experience, but it did have its high points. I struggled for a long time to complete a [fill-in-the-blanks quiz](https://github.com/strongdan/udacity-nd-fill-in-the-blanks-quiz) using Python 3. The earlier lessons, such as creating a webpage, didn't seem to require much programming at all and weren't terribly difficult. As a final project, we created a movie website that used Python objects to represent movies with their poster images. Again, this project wasn't terribly hard and I don't think I learned a ton by going through the process of making it. It was sort of a programming-by-numbers experience. 

I'm happy that I went through the process and I still am quite fond of Udacity as a teaching platform. I don't think that the projects I completed were particularly impressive, certainly not enough to get me hired in tech. But the process of becoming a professional programmer is a slow one and I'm happy to return to the basics if necessary.
