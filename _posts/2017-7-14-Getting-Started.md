title: A First Post to Get Things Rolling
---

This is my first real foray into blogging and an attempt to share what I'm learning as I begin to get serious about programming. My hope is that I might help others who are also beginners and who feel overwhelmed and lost as I have. The process of becoming a hireable programmer can be very challenging, and I want beginning programmers to know that they're not the only ones struggling. It seems that tenacity in the early stages of programming pays off more than almost anywhere else in life. Learning to persist in the face of confusion and frustration is a skill that will help out elsewhere, so learning to program has value outside of making more money. That is, I assume, why so many people are keen on becoming developers right now. From what I can tell, having skills as a programmer also open up new opportunities in unexpected places - social science, business, etc. 

I'm currently in the process of learning advanced Javascript, and I will pass along what I've learned here on this blog. I'm also quite interested in Ruby and Python for data analysis, so those topics will occasionally make it to the blog here. I plan to write a bit about scoping and higher order functions in Javascript. Those are topics that I need some help on myself, so my hope is that by explaining them to others I might better understand them myself. I love doing data manipulation and visualization using Pandas (Python) and Jupyter Notebooks, and I will try to include some basic tutorials in that area as well.
