<h3>Data.gov CKAN API</h3>
You can fetch metadata for data.gov data sets, including URLs and data descriptions, by visiting the CKAN API at: [http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/](http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/), but you'll have to visit each agency's API if you would like to extract data. Not every federal agency has an API at the time of this writing.
