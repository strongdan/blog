<>(I've got two things I want you to do this time--both of which should help you get some extra traffic.

#The first is to write up a post on your blog about this email course.

#Make sure within the post you link to https://simpleprogrammer.com (so, I see the pingback that lets me know you wrote the post) and for #the email course sign-up, you can link to https://simpleprogrammer.com/blog-course.

#Wait a minute... won't that generate traffic for me and not for you?

Well, not really. If you just created your blog, I'm not going to be getting much traffic from it, but there are two reasons I am asking you to do this:

1. I am going to be putting a list together of all the blog posts talking about this email course and I'll be linking to them. That means—as long as you write a quality post about this email course—I will link to you from Simple Programmer. This will help you get some traffic (remember how important backlinks are). Just make sure you write a quality post—that's all I ask.

2. I would like you to help promote this email course so that I can reach more developers with it. If you are getting some value from this course, please share it. (Here's a handy link to send a quick tweet about the course - http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiOTUyNDk2NiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMTE0MTAzOTUwMSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9jdHQuZWMvWHF6aEU_X19zPXZpZnJvaW5ncmtxc2o5Ym45Y3VkIn0)

Finally, your 2nd homework assignment is to find some post on Simple Programmer and comment on it.

You should already know why this is valuable. Simple Programmer gets over 7,000 views a day, so if you write a quality comment, there is a good chance you'll get some traffic back to your own blog.)
