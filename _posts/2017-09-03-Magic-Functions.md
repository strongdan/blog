title: Getting Started With Magic Functions

Run `%magic` to get a list of magic functions in Jupyter Notebooks, and you'll get documentation that looks like this:

```
IPython's 'magic' functions
===========================

The magic function system provides a series of functions which allow you to
control the behavior of IPython itself, plus a lot of system-type
features. There are two kinds of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented.
